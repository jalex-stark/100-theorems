# 100-theorems

Here we give Lean statements of several problems on [this list maintained by Freek Wiedjik](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) which have not yet been formalized in Lean. The latter property is determined by this [this list maintained by the mathlib community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/100.html).
